# SERUM-PLASMA-BRIDGING-2025
## Overview
This repository contains the code used to generate figures for the manuscript "Bridging the Gap: A Systematic Approach to Integrating Serum and Plasma Proteomic Datasets for Biomarker Studies" (currently under submission). This study presents a computational approach for bridging between serum and plasma proteomic datasets derived from the aptamer-based SomaScan assay, enabling cross-specimen data use in the context of the PROphet model designed to predict immunotherapy outcomes.
